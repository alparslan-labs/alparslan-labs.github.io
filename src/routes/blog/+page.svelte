    Farming Humans
    While AI should serve humanity (atleast in our view) there are people who do their best 
    to channel R&D efforts in another direction. With recent advancs in AI and the shift
     towards generative AI, all available data sources have been exploited hoping to
      build AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) not worrying 
    about the consequences. As a result, data protection regulations are ignored and 
    systems design is increasingly addressed at data collection for model training.
