		Two thirds of our staff are fully devoted to Research & Development. Our scientists have different backgrounds, but they are all mad about finding state-of-the-art solutions to financial challenges. And that includes exploring every technique, every unanswered question, and every path that may lead us to our goals.

		This blog is one of those paths. A space to experiment, to search for creativity. A place to share, to keep learning.

		Above all, a space to dare, experiment, learn and earn from trial and error.</p> <p>We are a team of Quant Researchers, Data and Software Engineers
